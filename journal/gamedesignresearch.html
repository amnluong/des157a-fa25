                <p> I think it is crucial and very important to know the comfortable-to-reach areas on the phone. Putting buttons on the bottom of the screen will be better to be able to reach the buttons easily without reaching your finger across the screen horizontally. When I type on my phone with one hand it is hard to reach to the other side of the keyboard so it is crucial to think about the placements of buttons. Game designs may have a lot of content within them so using sliders while making sure visible items are visible is a great way to show multiple information. It also does not overwhelm me or other users with all the information at once. Pop-ups are also a great technique to include in game designs but an important practice is to include a “done” or “continue” button instead of an X button for the popup. I tend to associate it with a negative or annoying intention and will click the X button right away. When I want users to click a specific button, for example, if I ask them if they want to quit the game or not, I should use color to emphasize the no button. It tells the users what they want to click and is usually a button the users will graduate towards no matter what their decision is. There are times when I would scan and automatically click the button that is more emphasized to quickly get through the steps which helped me save time. When I want to show the intro video right when users open the app make users do something to reveal a skip button. Many users like myself get impatient really quickly and if they see the skip button already, it escalates their impatience even more. </p>
