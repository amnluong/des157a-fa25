    <h2> Website Form Usability Thoughts </h2>
    <p> When creating a form the less is more theory is significant since people do not like to spend a lot of time on it. Asking only relevant questions/ providing relevant information is key to success in having the users complete the form. To have users complete the form smoothly, designers have to style the form to make it easy for users to understand and complete fast. Single columns are key to keeping the users on flow and completing the form faster. Providing a clear image of how far users are in completing the form increases the number of form completion. If the users see that they are almost done with the form, the likeness of completing it increases. Ask easy questions first then proceed to ask harder questions because if the questions are hard first, the users tend to give up easily. </p>

    <p> Other designs that make it easier for users overall is to mark required fields so users understand which ones they have to fill in. It allows users to move on through the questions a lot quicker because they know when to skip questions. Also label the fields/box on the top not inside the field so it doesnâ€™t disappear when the user starts typing in the field. Users may forget what they need to type in the box. Use the same size for the fields every time so it does not look awkward when you make one field smaller than the other. Minimize the dropdown menus if there are less than 6 items because they will make interactions quicker for users and minimize the number of clicks. All of these techniques create a user-friendly form that allows users to complete it in a timely manner and without issue. </p>
