                            <p> Alejandra’s image is of nature. It shows the water, sunset, and mountain.  The most interesting thing is the sunset and how the sun shines on a part of the mountain. It is also interesting because it is obvious that it shows scenery and we can see that Alejandra was either hiking or sitting, viewing the scenery, but the most mysterious thing is the mood she felt when she was there. I wonder if she was having a great day while on a hike alone or with friends or if she went there because she was having a hard time... </p>

                            <p> Pictures tell us everything from the small details to big details. I think we have to become detectives when we look at a picture because there are a lot of details hiding from the main event. It takes a lot of practice observing pictures and predicting what is happening in the photos. I would need to keep on asking myself open-ended questions because I wouldn't be able to think about something unless I was asked a question... </p>

                            <p> A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application’s main window. It disables the main window but keeps it visible with the model window as a child window in front of it. You may want to use the modal window when you need to grab the user’s attention, need user input, show additional information in context, and show additional information that is not in context...  </p>

                                <p> When creating a form the less is more theory is significant since people do not like to spend a lot of time on it. Asking only relevant questions/ providing relevant information is key to success in having the users complete the form. To have users complete the form smoothly, designers have to style the form to make it easy for users to understand and complete fast... </p>
